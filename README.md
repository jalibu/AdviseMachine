## About
A time ago I stumbled  upon [Nick’s Blog](http://blog.notdot.net/2012/09/Penny-for-your-thoughts). He built an Advice Machine based on the credit card sized micro computer „Raspberry Pi“ and some additional hardware. I was totally impressed about his work and driven to build a similar machine on my own.  
It came the day when I helped as a volunteer at my old scout association at the local christmas market. The scouts were selling „Glühwein“ and „Bratwurst“ to get some extra money for their next summer camp. I was trying to find a way to keep people’s glass deposit of 2 Euros in our hands. Just asking for a donation was embarrassing and unimaginative. This was when I remembered the machine as a way to give our customers a little gift for their donation and to put a little smile on their faces.
